The solution can be run with:
 - npm run start - To build and run the mock backend.
 - npm run build - To build the UI. If you'd like to work actively you can run npm run watch so webpack will track your
  changes automatically.
- npm run dev - To start the React application at port 9500.

Here are some comments:
- Unfortunately I had around 8 work hours for the task, so it's not in a pixel perfect state. I think the most
  important functionality should be there though.
- Running the API is not explained well enough. On a Windows machine I was unable to run it so had
  to reside to WSL. Someone with less general computer knowledge could have been blocked.
- The API images sources are broken, thus I had to reside to the channel name.
- Not being able to use builders could create lots of places for mistakes. I'm pretty sure my setup is far from great.
  I understand the reasoning behind this request though.
- The global variables could have been extracted to a utility class.
- Didn't have time for implementing panning scroll on desktop. On mobile, it's native so no worries there.
- CSS preprocessor purposefully not added due to the small size of the application.
- The time tracker bar is purposefully not automatically refreshing on a given interval. If needed could be
  easily added.
